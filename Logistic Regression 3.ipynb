    "EDA and Feature Engeenearing : Now we need to do the exploratary data analysis, in which we need to visulazing the data. Applying the statistic function to see the correleations and beasic info of the data. In feature Engeenearing we need to make the data ready for model. Doing some basic cleaning like finding the null value if exist and fill it with various ways by imputation techniques. Using the upasampling and downsamplaing for imbalanced data set if required. If the features has outliers and values are too big then also use the scaling techniques as standered scaling.\n",

    "Train the Model : After doing all these thing we are going to train our data with the logistic regression. There are some libraries as sklearn by which we can easily train our data with the help of  x_train and y_train. After this process we are going for predict varible which is used in performance checking. \n",

    "Hyperperameter Tunning : By usning the hyperperameter tunning we can incresed of model performance, many types of cross validation are also take part on this and improving the health of the model . we can use Grid Search cv and randomized search for such opreations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing the performance : After completing the training of the data, we need to check the performance of our model so we can decide the best perameters for the model and make it better to more better. for this we are using performance matrics as confusion matrix , recall, beta score band precision.\n",
